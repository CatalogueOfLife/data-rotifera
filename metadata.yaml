# Multi parapgraph description / abstract of the dataset
description: | 
    Following ICZN Article 79 (Chapter 17 of the Code), 
    a committee of experts developed Candidate Parts of the List of Available Names in Zoology 
    for genus- and species-group taxa of Rotifera from the start of zoological nomenclature to the year 2000 (Jersabek et al. (2018a, b). 
    Details of how the Candidate Parts were assembled are described in Zootaxa 3179: 61–68 (2012) by the expert rotifer taxonomy committee of Segers et al., 2012. 
    The Candidate Parts have been officially adopted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature under the plenary power, effective 30 April 2019 (ICZN, 2019). 

    The rotifer species-group Part is divided into two sections. 
    The A-list includes names that are proposed to be included in the List of Available Names in Zoology; 
    The B-list includes names of rotifers that are proposed not to be included in the LAN for reasons described in Segers et al. (2012).
